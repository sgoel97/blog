[In Progress]

As a resident of chicago, the greater chicagoland area (for the majority of my life), the bay area, and (somewhat more dubiously) new york city, and having traveled to all ends of the United States, I can say, with confidence, that Chicago is the best city in America, and most likeley the world.

Before you start argueing with me, let's define what "best" means here. I'm not using a single one of nightlife, daylife, or quality-of-life in my decision, but all three. New York may have better nightlife, but Chicago has better quality-of-life before 10pm. San Fransisco may have better nature, but can't hold a candle to Chicago's nightlife. Each city has tradeoffs, but Chicago is the city that best combines each of these aspects of life in a metropolitan area.

If you're visitng Chicago, it can feel overwhelming trying to decide where to visit and what to do. The easy thing about Chicago, however, is that all the attractions you see when you search "things to do in Chicago" are amazing. Unlike many cities (_cough_ Times Square _cough_), the touristy spots in Chicago are definite must-sees and won't dissapoint (_cough_ Union Square _cough_).

Below I've outlined my recommended places to visit in Chicago, along with some great places to eat. Hopefully this guide can help add some direction to your trip, and help you fall in love with Chicago just as much as I have.

## My Hitlist

I've lived in Chicago or the Greater Chicagoland Area for most of my life, so this list si somewhat sparse, and focuses more on smaller, more unique visits that aren't quite as popular as the destinations listed above. One disclaimer: don't consider these experiences as hidden gems. Make sure to explore the destinations I listed above first to get a true taste of Chicago, and only then look for additional experiences.

## Aknowledgements

Shoutout to my parents for deciding to settle down in the chicago suburbs and for letting me explore as a kid. I always loved visiting the big city, and am eternally grateful for the opportunity to be able to see the world around me as I have and hope to continue doing.
