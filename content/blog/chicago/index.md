As a resident of Chicago, the greater Chicagoland area (for the majority of my life), the Bay Area, and (somewhat more dubiously) New York City, and having traveled to all ends of the United States, I can say, with confidence, that Chicago is the best city in America, and potentially the world.

Now, before you contest my statement, let's clarify what "best" means in this context. I'm taking into account nightlife, daytime activities, and overall quality of life. While New York might boast superior nightlife, Chicago offers a better quality of life before 10 pm. San Francisco may have a closer connection to nature, but it pales in comparison to Chicago's vibrant nightlife. In essence, Chicago is the metropolis that most effectively balances these crucial aspects of urban living.

Planning a visit to Chicago can feel daunting, with so many sights and activities to choose from. Fortunately, when you search for "things to do in Chicago," you'll discover that the city's iconic attractions are genuinely exceptional. Unlike some cities (ahem, Times Square), Chicago's tourist hotspots are must-sees that won't leave you disappointed (looking at you, Union Square).

In this blog post, I've compiled my top recommendations for places to visit in Chicago, as well as some fantastic dining options. Hopefully this guide can help add some direction to your trip, and help you fall in love with Chicago just as much as I have.
