[In Progress]

Learning full-stack development can feel overwhelming. With the vast amount of resources available, all claiming to be the best way to become a pro, It's easy to get stuck in indecision and end up only learning half of a subject without truly understanding how to build an app from scratch.

To solve this problem, I've created a roadmap that helps you cut through the noise and focus on the fundamentals necessary to start building your own amazing websites, platforms, and apps. Having taught full-stack development to over 500 students at all levels and with experience building projects used by hundreds of thousands of people, I can confidently say that these courses, along with your own practice, will turn you into a strong engineer.

In this guide, we'll cover courses that teach you the following skills.

**Frontend Development:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React.js

**Backend Development:** Node.js, APIs, Networking, Servers, Nginx

**DevOps:** Amazon Web Services, Git

Additionally, I'll reference additional courses and resources that cover the following.

**Frontend Development:** React Native, Typescript, Electron, Gatsby, Webpack

**Backend Development:** MongoDB, Express, Python Frameworks

Alright, let's get started!

## TLDR;

If you want to skip the words and dive straight into the courses I reccomend, check out [this infographic](https://www.figma.com/file/k47TQGZtVjwlp1d9mRD9kg/Web-Dev-Learning-Path?node-id=0%3A1) I put together that summarizes the core information in this post. If you want more detail on the steps and reccomendations I have for learning full-stack development beyond just the roadmap, however, read on.

## Setup

Many of these courses are taught by [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/), an educational platform with dozens of high-quality courses encompassing frontend, backend, and devops. If you're a student, you can get 6 months free by using the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), a collection of free CS resources for students offered by GitHub. Even if you don't end up using Frontend Masters, the pack includes amazing resources for students, such as GitHUb Pro, Azure and Heroku credits, and 3 weeks of access to Interview Cake. Even without the pack, you can access most of the courses in this roadmap for free, so no worries if you're not a student!

## First Steps

Let's start with an overview of frontend development, putting into perspective some of the buzzwords you might have seen before.

The core technologies of frontend development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS are used to create the actual look of a website. Think of the structure, color, and words on a website - these all come from HTML and CSS. Most informational websites you see on the internet require just HTML/CSS to make. Next is JavaScript. You can think of JavaScript (JS) as the logic behind a website. Let's use Amazon as an example. Everything you see and interact with when browing for an item is just data you see, and doesn't actually have any logic behind it. This is all just HTML and CSS. When you go to buy something, however, we are using payment logic, and this is where JavaScript comes in. Another example is when you are searching for a specific item on Amazon. When you hit the search button, we use JavaScript to decide what items to show you.

In frontend development, everything compiles down to these thre things: HTML, CSS, and JS. If you've heard of React or Node, these are just frameworks built on top of JavaScript, and use HTML/CSS to actually work under the hood. In fact, most frameworks and tools you've heard of are just some way to work with HTML/CSS/JS that make your life easier or make these tools more powerful.

### Our First Stop: Complete Intro to Web Development

Given that most of web and frontend development boils down to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this is where we're going to get started. [Complete Intro to Web Development, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/) is the best course for frontend beginners, covering these three core topics from a fundamental perspective, and is comprehensive enough even for those who've never coded before to follow along with. This course is a must for anyone who wouldn't consider themselves as having an **at least** intermediate knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, as its easy to "know" these tools without actually being able to use them effectively.

### Step Two: Understanding the Internet

Now that we've gotten a solid understanding of how to build a website, let's turn our attention to how information, including our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, actually get sent and used over the internet.
