[Rough Draft]

Welcome to Samarth's guide on what to do, places to see, and good restaurants to eat while in or near San Fransisco!

San Francisco is one of my all-time favorite cities. When I first moved to the area, I saw it as a fun place to visit, but it wasn't until I ventured beyond downtown and started exploring the west side of the city that I truly fell in love with it. In my opinion, San Francisco excels in two areas: food and nature. If you're a fan of these two things like I am, then you're sure to fall in love with this city too.

One of the things I love most about San Francisco is the variety of memorable places to visit. Whether you're a newcomer to the area or a seasoned veteran, there's always something new and exciting to discover. Below are a few of my top recommendations for anyone looking to explore the city.

## Places to Eat

#### Price: $

- [Chinatown] Capital restaurant

Pretty good authentic chinese restaurant.

#### Price: $$

- [Richmond District] Lokma

I've been here for brunch, and Lokma never dissapoints. The potatoes are especially amazing.

- [Richmond District] JiJime

Great casual korean restaurant.

- [Japantown] Kura sushi

Rotating sushi bar in the Japantown mall. I've heard mixed reviews, but I liked it quite a bit when i went.

- [Fisherman's Wharf] Surisan

One of my favorite places in SF, and my go-to restaurant in a pinch. Brunch and dinner are both amazing, and Surisan consistently has top-quality korean food with a modern twist.

#### Price: $$$

- [FiDi] Happy Lamb Hot Pot

Solid spot for Hot Pot in SF. The lamb here is pretty good given it's hard to find a variety of lamb at other hot pot places.

- [FiDi] Bodega SF

Amazing spot for modern vietnamese spot. A bit on the pricier side, but would 100% reccomend. Great bar vibe.

#### Price: $$$$

- [Chinatown] Empress by Boon

While the food was pretty good, the presentation is what makes Empress by Boon so memorable. The restaurant is located on the 8th floor of a chinatown building, and the aesthetic is that of an upscale chinese penthouse. The plating is incredible, with lots of fun surprises throughout the 8-course menu.

- [Nob Hill] Acquerello

One of the best meals I've ever had. Lower on the quantity side, but the food they serve is pretty dense. If you come, make sure to savor each bite - you'll be longing for more at the end of the meal. Strong traditional fine dining vibe - there is a dress code.

- [Japantown] An Sushi

The best Omakase I've had to date. Not too pricy for Omakase at around $100 for their highest-course option. Plating was amazing, and while not as traditional, the food was better than any traditional Omakase I've been to.
