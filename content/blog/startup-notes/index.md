First blog post of 2024 - let's get into it!

## The Problem

Let's get straight into focusing on **the problem with startups at Berkeley**: Many of them don't need to exist.

While more foreign to students at other strong schools outside the Bay Area, startup culture is nothing new at Berkeley. Instead, the startup culture itself is a big draw for many prospective students looking to "change the world" (more on this later). With students across the spectrum looking to start the next big thing, and the you can do it culture of UC Berkeley, cultuvated by the extremely strong student-run venture and consulting club presence, it's no wonder that every fifth person you talk to has decided to start something at some point in their Berkeley career. Surrounded by so many "success stories" (read: getting funded), and ambitious peers, students in this bucket honestly experience a level of peer pressure to create their own venture.

Here's where the first problem comes into play: **Startups that succeed tend to solve a problem - most students, especially at elite institutions, haven't experienced real-world business problems**.

This isn't any fault of the students themselves, but rather a function of youth and privelage. Many of UC Berkeley's students fought their way through competitive high schools, even middle and elementary schools, to earn their spot at Berkeley. This unfortunately necessitates a strong singular focus of getting into college, and leaves little room for activies that don't contribute to this goal in some way. This can often culminate in a life centered around school and extracurriculurs, olympiads, and after-school tutoring. There's not much thought given to ~why~ the world is the way it is, but rather most thought centers around ~how~ to work within the existing status quo. Even after entering college, the most ambitious students get bmbarded with dreams of getting a job at an Investment Bank, a Big 4, or a FAANG company. There's not much prestige attached to doing the dirty work of building a startup that solves a real-world problem - instead all the clout associated with startups goes to those building sexy new tech and getting funding from big-name VCs. Because students have trusted authority all their lives (parents, US News Rankings, etc), it follows that adults dumping millions of dollars into startups would know what ideas are good, what ideas are bad, and invest accordingly. The problem with this line of thinking though, is that if authority was always right, we wouldn't have many problems left in the world. Even if VCs had a 50% success rate, the strategy would simply be to talk to enough VCs, trust their advice, and then go and build a successfull startup, successfull because the VCs said it would be - if only this was the case.

This, in a nutshell is the second problem: **Students blindly trust authority figures, despite authority figures often being incorrect**.

Let's actually elaborate on that: **Students don't know who the right authority figures to trust are, so they default to the most vocal**.

What does this mean? Each sector has its own expert figures and investors with respectable success rates, and these are rarely overlap with the Silicon Valley VC cabal that students know and love. This ties into the deeper problem of students not knowing industries in the first place. While everyone is aware of finance, construction, legal, it's rare for a student to understand how each industry works, who the key players are, the key startups, investors, and workflows that go into making these industries run. Without this knowledge, which is difficult to obtain without real-world experience, it's nigh impossible to understand what is a good solution and which startups are doomed to failure within a specific vertical.

## Idea Exploration and Validation

When a student wants to create a startup but doesn't have a deep understanding of problems facing their industry of choice, and is unable to delve deep into to find and understand these problems, you get someone thinking from a solution-first mindset. This is a trap typical to everyone, not just college students, which is thinking about potential solutions on their own merits, and not on the merits of the problems they solve. This type of thinking can lead to grandoise vision, inflated TAM, and a pitch deck with just enough substance to fool mid-tier VCs.

Often these ideas fail to generate revenue and have a hard time gaining traction or market share because often times their value proposition to the people they're selling to is unclear. This differs between B2B solutions and B2C apps.

B2C plays are the most common type of student startup. When choosing a customer to build for, it's easy to build for an audience you have familiarity with, and in today's world, everyone is a consumer. One example of this is a social media app. Most students use multiple social media apps and have their gripes for each one. It stands to reason then that since you know the competition and their shortcomings, you could do better. This, unfortunately, is where the spiral of wide-eyed

## Execution

The biggest lesson here is that **students often underestimate the level of execution needed to create a successful startup**.
