## Ethereum

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLkbJozKbY

Really useful primer on ethereum and the basics of blockchain technology

- https://weth.io/

Good explanation for why WETH (Wrapped Eth) Exists

## AMMs

### Curve (StableSwap)

Curve was a somewhat hard one, since the whitepaper wasn't particularly as helpful as online resources in understanding the derivation of the StableSwap Invariant.

**Prereqs:** Make sure you've read and understood the UniSwap whitepaper, especially the constant product AMM formula and the concept of a constant product invariant.

- [Curve StableSwap Whitepaper](https://curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf)

Even though it's pretty confusing and doesn't explain algorithm design decisions as well as it could, definitely start here to learn about Curve and the StableSwap invariant. Don't worry if you're confused, just read through this and then look through the next resource I've linked in this article.

- [Explanation of the StableSwap Invariant](https://miguelmota.com/blog/understanding-stableswap-curve/)

Read this to understand the design decisions behind the StableSwap invariant. Explains the math much more intuitively than the Curve whitepaper. I would reccomend re-reading the Curve StableSwap Whitepaper after understanding the math better through this article.

## Impermenant Loss

This article is good for understanding the basics of the math behind impermenant loss.

- https://medium.com/auditless/how-to-calculate-impermanent-loss-full-derivation-803e8b2497b7

Derives the impermenant loss formula.
