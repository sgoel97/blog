## Ride-Share and Blockchain Architecture

During surge pricing or odd hours, Uber and Lyft prices tend to skyrocket. Even when you think that you've booked a ride for cheap or reserved in advance, it might take forever to match you to an Uber, and if you were to cancel and try again, you would probably see that the price has risen by quite a bit. My hypothesis for why this happens is that these services need sufficient incentive in the form of a higher fee for drivers to agree to rides during these rarer events, which I find somewhat akin to how gas is used in Crypto. When a network such as Ethereum is busier, gas prices rise can rise drastically. Similarly, these ride-share services can be thought of as a decentralized system that uses the concept of gas in the form of price setting. Drivers are analogous to the miners who approve transactions on the blockchain and who both know they can charge more for their services when there's a lot of traffic/demand.
