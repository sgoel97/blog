### Ride-Share and Blockchain Architecture

During surge pricing or odd hours, the prices for Uber and Lyft tend to skyrocket. Even when you think that you've booked a ride for cheap or reserved in advance, it might take forever to match you to an Uber, and if you were to cancel and try again, you would probably see that the price has risen by quite a bit. My hypothesis for why this happens is that these services need sufficient incentive in the form of a higher fee for drivers to agree to rides during these rarer events, which I find somewhat akin to how gas is used in Crypto. When a network such as Ethereum is busier, gas prices rise and the fee to use the network is increased. Similarly, these ride-share services can be thought of as a decentralized system that requires gas. The drivers and analogous to the miners who approve transactions on the blockchain, and who need a sufficient incentive to do so when there's a lot of traffic.
