Some study tips I find helpful. While studying is different for everyone, these tips tend to hold regardless of study style.

#### Out of site, out of mind

Mostly applies to my phone and any other distractions that might occur. Even when my phone is out of sight, I like to either close out of all districtive tabs or have the thing I'm studying be in it's own browser window to minimize distractions.

#### Repetition is key

I don't know if this is scientifically true, but my AP Physics teacher told me that AP students need 2-3 repetitions to understand something, and then more are required for other students, or something like that, but the point here is that unless you're a 200 IQ genius, you need to go over something **more than once** to actually get it. This applies to readings, homeworks, and derivations, everything really! Going over something for the second time personally really helps with my understanding of it.

Of course, you shouldn't just go over something and then immediettly go over it again. While this will definetely still help more thna just going over it once, I personally find it helpful to have a gap between readings. This way the ideas from what I'm looking at have some time to marinate in my head and internalize a bit (which ties into my next point) before I look at what I was looking at again.

#### Don't read to understand, read to internalize
