How to land a job in quant finance (focused primarily on trading).

**Disclaimer:** All statements here are of my own opinion from personal experience and what I've heard.

### Applying

#### Resume

Make sure to optimize your resume towards a focus on math and data science. If you did math competitions in high school make sure to include those, along with your high school info if you had high standardized test scores. All other standard resume tips apply. [Here's a link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/148Ad8l0MkVTAP32JlLGYae27r5G_59URGUUWXpTVLFQ/edit?usp=sharing) to a a resume template I like and use.

#### Timeline

Most quant job listings come out in Late July/August, though 2-3 firms tend to start earlier (Late March/April). I would highly recommend applying starting from Late March/April to these earlier firms and then applying as soon as possible to other firms in the summer. The earlier you apply, the better chance you have of getting an offer. In general, make sure to apply as soon as the listing is open. If you have a deadline, make sure to let firms know via application or email, and they'll most likely give you an early interview even if their applications haven't opened yet.

#### Referrals

While referrals can help, don't focus on creating connections within the industry, and certainly don't sacrifice time preparing for the interview for the sake of networking. Compared to other industries, referrals and connections in quant mean significantly less, and time spent preparing for the interview will serve you better than any extra time spent getting a referral.

#### Year in School

Never, ever say you're a sophomore or a freshman, because that means an automatic rejection from any quant internship. If you're a freshman or a sophomore, there's specific programs that you can apply to, such as [Jane Street's FTTP](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/our-programs/fttp/), [Citadel's Discover Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/careers/launch-your-career/discover-citadel/), and [D.E. Shaw's Fellowship Programs](https://www.deshaw.com/careers/fellowships), amongst some others.

### Preparation

##### Classes and Areas of Study

- Mental Math

The bread and butter of trading, make sure your mental math game is on point. While there are no classes for this, make sure to practice it often while doing practice problems in math, probability, or any other technical field, or even in everyday life! A good resource to practice your mental math skills is [ZetaMac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/). Use the default settings, and try to score above 40. if you can't do it initially, keep on practicing! Just like everything else, practicing mental math often makes you both faster and better at it.

- Probability

This one is by far the most important topic to understand. A lot of trading interviews won't even test your programming skills and only your understanding of math and probability. Thus it is **paramount** to understand probability inside and out. Make sure you take at least one upper-division probability course. I would recommend [Data 140](http://prob140.org/) or [EECS 126](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee126/sp22/) for this. EECS 126 covers more, but Data 140 goes more in-depth and is more related to the type of stuff you'll see in interviews, so I'd recommend that over EECS 126. If you take Data 140, I'd personally recommend [Stat 150](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bensonau/f21.150/index.html) to cover stochastic processes, which sometimes appear in interviews (but not very often). Stat 150 is definitely unnecessary as the Green Book (which I talk about below) coveres everything you need to know about markov chains and martingales, but I personally enjoyed the class a lot and found it useful for my own understanding of stochastic processes.

- Programming and Algorithms

Make sure to have [CS 170](https://cs170.org/) level knowledge of programming and algorithms. This typically requires [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/), [CS 61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/), [CS 70](https://www.eecs70.org/), and of course CS 170. Python tends to be the preferred language for quantitative finance.

- Linear Algebra and Calculus

Not super important, but if you have time, make sure to brush up on basic Linear Algebra and Calculus. Make sure to have some sort of understanding of the math taught in classes like Math 53 and Math 54, focusing more on Linear Algebra rather than Calculus. If you did Multivariable Calculus and/or Linear Algebra in high school, that should be enough as well.

- Machine Learning and Data Science (Quantitative Research Roles)

This is more so for Quantitative Research roles, but knowing linear regression inside and out is paramount for interviews. Good classes for this are Data 100 for basic numpy/pandas, Stat 151A or Econ 142 for linear modeling, and [CS 189](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/) for general understanding of prediction techniques. None of these classes cover linear regression in-depth enough, however, so you'll need to engage in independent study as well.

For data science, you will most likely be asked about the data science process and techniques. For example, they will ask you to predict something, and you'll have to determine what data you need, how to collect it, how to process it, and finally how to use it to predict what you need to find. As far as I'm aware no class covers this explicitly and is more so built with real experience working with data and machine learning.

#### Books

- "A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews" by Xinfeng Zhou

Often referred to as "The Green Book", this is the holy grail of interview prep for Quantitative Finance Interviews. Focus on Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 for trading interviews. Free PDF versions of the book can easily be found online.

- "Quant Job Interview Questions And Answers" by Mark Joshi

This book is also useful when preparing for quant interviews. Like the Green Book, free pdf versions of this book can be found online easily. Make sure to go through the Green Book first, however, and this book afterwards as a supplemental piece.

### After the Offer

Make sure to negotiate! Most firms will include or increase their sign-on bonus if you negotiate or if you let them know you have a competing offer or are in the final rounds with another company.

#### Leveraging an Offer

If you receive an offer, make sure to let everybody you're interviewing with know. The same goes with final rounds for any well-known company. This makes it seem as if you're in high demand, and will be seen as a positive when firms are making their final hiring decision.

#### Community

If you have an offer, make sure to join the [Traders/Quants/Devs Discord](https://discord.gg/9caQmCcvRZ)! You'll need an offer letter to join any of the useful or company-specific channels, so this is a task that's only possible once you recieve an offer.
