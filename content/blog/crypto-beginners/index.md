Crypto may seem daunting, and understanding everything that's out there, as well as the mechanics behind it, can seem incredibly confusing. Hopefully, this simple analogy can help shed a little bit of light on a more traditional way to view crypto and how to interpret all of the price movements and news that you see.

You can imagine the world of crypto and blockchain as the stock market. The more that Bitcoin gets used, for example, the higher the price of Bitcoin becomes. Similarly the more that Ethereum gets used, the higher the price of Ethereum goes. The core difference between these 2, however, is that Bitcoin is simply a cryptocurrency and has no inherent use case other than being used for transactions. On the other hand, Ethereum is a network that people can use to build blockchain-based applications. Thus, the more applications that are built on top of Ethereum, the more Ethereum gets used, and so the price of Ethereum goes up.

To delve a bit deeper, whenever an application is used that's built on top of Ethereum, the user must pay a small fee of Ethereum, which is typically called a **gas fee**. Thus, when applications that are built on top of Ethereum are used, the price of Ethereum gets used, as more people are using Ethereum.

Every other coin works the same way. You can think of a token or coin as being the **stock** for the company or platform that it represents. For example, let's say you built an application on top of the Ethereum network, and publish a coin for your application. If your application gets used a lot, then the price of your coin will increase, just as how a company's stock increases if the company is doing well.

Additionally, the network that you build your application on will also benefit, since fees using the application are paid in that network's token. Going back to the previous example, if you deploy your app on the Ethereum network, all fees must be paid in ETH. If you build and deploy your app on the Avalanche network, all fees must be paid in AVAX. Thus it is beneficial for blockchain-based networks to have engineers build and deploy more cool and popular applications on their networks.

Now we have a sense of how to view the tokens for networks (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) and platforms (UniSwap, Aave, etc.) but what about Bitcoin? Bitcoin doesn't have an inherent company or platform behind it. Rather, Bitcoin is its own company. The more people that use Bitcoin in transactions, the higher the price will go, and vice versa. This is because Bitcoin was the first major cryptocurrency to be used, and is still the gateway into the rest of the crypto world, and thus has less structure than Ethereum, which is an actual network, or another coin with an actual platform/company behind it.

This is an incredibly simplified version of how coin prices work in crypto, but hopefully comparing it to the stock market helped make the notion of crypto make more sense. What follows is a bit of a deeper dive into the supply-and-demand economics of cryptocurrencies, which are a bit closer to reality in how coins are priced.
