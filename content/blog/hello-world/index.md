Hello all, and welcome to Samarth's blog! This is my first blog post, and while it may one day become a sappy and emotional monologue on my motivations behind starting this journey, I'll keep it brief for now.

In this blog, I will try to:

- Share resources I find helpful
- Create educational and (hopefully) helpful content
- Write down any random thoughts or observations I want to share
- Convey my thoughts on philosophical and life matters

Hopefully, the contents of my blog are helpful to you! If you want to collab in any way, feel free to reach out to sgoel9@berkeley.edu.
