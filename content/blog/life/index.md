**Disclaimer:** This post is going to sound incredibly stupid. That's because life and the collective of humanity along with this concept we call existance is also incredibly stupid.\*

\*But also because I wrote it at 2am with no clear direction of what to talk about.

I don't stress much. In fact, I try to smile as much as I can! I can genuinely say I feel happy in life, and if I were to die today, I could die happy. That's not to say I would be fine with it - obviously I would want more time with my loved ones, more time to explore the globe, and more time to myself. But at the very least, i truly think I would be happy. I've experienced a lot of love, and I can truly say that I'm happy and generally excited for life. I'm glad to be surrounded by the people I'm around and the future is looking brighter every day.

Why is it then, that I find myself working as much as I am. I was at home for spring break, and I realized that instead of spending time with my family, I was busy trying to get through the UniSwap Whitepaper. I thought to myself for a moment - If i had $10 million, what would I spend my time on? It's not that I don't enjoy learning or doing what I do in my work, but my answer was pretty clear - I would spend more time with the people I love. Now that's easy to say since I don't actually have $10 million, but at a certain point it's important to prioritize. Even though I enjoyed learning and wasn't doing it for "the grind" or any unhealthy mentality like that, I realized that it could wait, but my parents and family couldn't.

I think that sort of thinking is what makes me smile. Realizing the true value of my time and where it needs to go, focusing on making myself happy through the companies of people I enjoy spending time with, focusing on nature, and letting life be a true 80/20 balancing act where 20% goes towards work. Unless you decide to go hard and be the next Elon Musk, the work you do in a 9-9 corporate day job isn't going to matter in the end. Unless you're truly making an impact (and I'm not talking about building your crypto devops ML startup), the work you do doesn't matter to anyone besides you, because all it's doing is dictating how you spend your time. Making money is important, but money and happiness have little correlation past a baseline. Pinning happiness on anything besides your own mentality is self-defeatist, and simply unsustainable.

Now onto awe. Isn't this world crazy? have you ever stopped to look at a leaf and be like "damn". No?

Think about a leaf. Think about all the crazy little cells inside the leaf working hard to make the leaf work. Think about the millions of years of evolution that went into the leaf, and how there's thousands of it right next to you, all with millions of cells all doing different things and serving various purposes to make that single, tiny leaf that you ripped apart with zero effort - function properly. Now think about the tree itself. Same thing. There's millions and millions of trees in your state alone, and you'll never see all of them, and they all have different cells than the leaf, and the tree will also definitely outlive you, and if it doesn't the millions of other trees that its friends with will. I dont know about you, but I think that's pretty awe-inducing.

Awe is what I think makes me the happiest and truly makes me realize the stupidity of life. You can work yourself to the bone, retire, and get replaced within 2 days. The company won't care about you, your co-workers probably forgot you (unless they want to use you to get a referral), but at the end of the day, the tree is still there, with its millions of tiny cells still working, still producing oxygen, still growing.

Want something even more stupid?

Stress - why? Stress is a net negative. if you could deal with the things you're stressed about without getting stressed, you'd probably do them better. Thus, why stress? What if you just didn't. And because its your mind, you can simply tell it not to with enough practice? Sounds incredibly stupid, but then again, that's the beuty of the human mind. Its yours, and it'll do whatever you tell it to.

[More Detail Coming Eventually]

Will I ever get to adding more detail to the sections above? I'm going to be perfectly honest, probably not but also potentially. Feel free to talk to me directly if you want to talk about this stuff in more depth, but only if you want to meet in-person, because, quite honestly, I find texting incredibly bothersome.
