## Interviewing

How to land a job in quant finance (focused primarily on trading).

### Applying

#### Resume

Make sure to optimize your resume towards a focus on math and data science. If you did math competitions in high school make sure to include those. All other standard resume tips apply.

#### Timeline

Most quant job listings come out in Late July/August, though 2-3 firms tend to start earlier (Late March/April). I would high reccomend applying starting from Late March/April to these earlier firms, and then applying as soon as possible to other firms in the summer. The earlier you apply, the better chance you have of getting an offer. In general, make sure to apply as soon as the listing is open. If you have a deadline, make sure to let firms know via application or email, and they'll most likely give you an early interview even if their applications haven't opened yet.

### Leveraging an Offer

If you recieve an offer, make sure to let everybody you're interviewing with know. The same goes with final rounds for any well-known company. This makes it seem as if you're in high-demand, and will be seen as a positive when firms are making their final hiring decision.

### Preparation

##### Classes and Areas of Study

- Probability

This one is by far the most important topic to understand. A lot of trading interviews won't even test your programming skills, and only your understanding of math and probability. Thus its **paramount** to understand probability inside and out. Make sure you take at least one upper-division probability course. I would reccomend Data 140 or EECS 126 for this. EECS 126 covers more, but Data 140 goes more in depth and is more related to the type of stuff you'll see in interviews, so I'd reccomend that over EECS 126. If you take Data 140, I'd also reccomend Stat 150 to cover stochastic processes, which sometimes appear in interviews (but not very often).

- Programming and Algorithms

Make sure to have CS 170 level knowledge of programming and algorithms. This typically requires CS 61A, CS 61B, CS 70, and of course CS 170.

- Linear Algebra and Calculus

Not super important, but if you have time, make sure to brush up on basic Linear Algebra and Calculus. Make sure to have some sort of understanding of the math taught in classes like Math 53 and Math 54, focusing more on Linear Algebra rather than Calculus. If you did Multivariable Calculus and/or Linear Algebra in high school, that should be enough as well.

- Machine Learning and Data Science (Quantitative Research Roles)

This is moreso for Quantitative Research roles, but knowing linear regression inside and out is paramount for interviews. Good classes for this are Data 100 for basic numpy/pandas, Stat 151A for linear modeling, and CS 189 for general understanding of prediction techniques. None of these classes cover linear regression in depth enough, however, so you'll need to engage in independent study as well.

For data science, you will most likeley be asked on data science process and techniques. For example, they will ask you to predict something, and you'll have to determine what data you need, how to collect it, how to process it, and finally how to use it to actually predict what you need to find. As far as I'm aware there's no class which covers this explicitly, and is moreso built with real experience working with data and machine learning.

#### Books

- A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews" by Xinfeng Zhou

Often referred to as "The Green Book", this is the holy grail of interview prep for Quantitative Finance Interviews. Focus on Chapters 1, 3, and 4 for trading interviews. Free PDF versions of the book can easily be found online.

### After the Offer

Make sure to negotiate! Most firms will include or increase their sign-on bonus if you negotiate or if you let them know you have a competing offer or are in the final rounds with another company.
